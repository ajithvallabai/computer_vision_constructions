## computer_vision_constructions

Computer vision is one of the field that has immense ability to reshape AI at every decade.You can even see evolution of organisms in accoradance with darwins theory .One of the important senses/ability primitive organisms would have had was eyes 
which helped them to move,find food,fight,protect,hide ,escape .

You know there are some pictures/movies where the picture/movie itself speaks i.e a langauge is born (no need to speak(audio))
similarly in language processing when you hear some stories/drama's you can get  vision or a perception.You can consider vision and language like a symbol of infinity .Infinity is not the end and this infinity gives a birth to cognition .

Dreams too comes in pictures/scenes.
