## Computer Vision Interview Preparation with Projects and codes

Computer vision is one of the field that has immense ability to reshape AI at every decade.You can even see evolution of organisms in accoradance with darwins theory .One of the important senses/ability primitive organisms would have had was eyes 
which helped them to move,find food,fight,protect,hide ,escape .

You know there are some pictures/movies where the picture/movie itself speaks i.e a langauge is born (no need to speak(audio))
similarly in language processing when you hear some stories/drama's you can get  vision or a perception.You can consider vision and language like a symbol of infinity .Infinity is not the end and this infinity gives a birth to cognition .

Dreams too comes in pictures/scenes.

### Prerequities

* Download linkedin, reddit app in mobile - join r/computervision,r/python,r/reinforcementlearning,r/deeplearning groups 
in reddit .Turn on notifications for reddit in both desktop and laptop .

* Maintain a git repo for all of the below things .it will be very helpfull in future .I get interview
calls through linkedin only after recruiter see my git profile .Maintain seperate git repo
for each step below.Also it will be use full when u r going to work in CV .

if google doesnt give u the code which u r looking for, search in github search.

Note : These are for entry level computer vision jobs . it is applicable for both freshers and experienced people from other domain

* One method is chosing appliedai course(asking for CV domain referal from them) and then doing below things because its hard to get a referal
in standard startups or MNC's when we dont have that particular domain experience . There 
is a emi option also . 
* Because until you have a small experience of 3 to 4 months in computer vision none of the CV recruiter will
even see you naukri profile/resume in naukri . when i got 4 months of experience in CV i get almost 4 or 5 interview 
calls for computer vision engineer every month till now and interview are also easy as it is a new area .
its your wish or you can try for 6-8 months by yourself and then apply for appliedai
if you didnt get a CV job. So there is a change of getting interview call for you only if its a walkin interview/linkedin recurier direct message
and its rare . (Your title in naukri or linkedin should be Computer vision engineer to even make some CV recurier to see your profile)
Updating your keyskill or any small thing everyday will make your activity higher in naukri 

* Apply to early stage startups if you are not getting calls

### Step 1-Initialization of basics

* Any 1 machine learning course - take notes for this course
* Any 1 deep learning course with computer vision -- upload all the projects u do here in git 

Recommended
* https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning

Mandatory 
* https://www.udemy.com/course/master-computer-vision-with-opencv-in-python/   

I recommend above course as one is theoretical which teachs basic interview questions . other
is project oriented course .

### Step 2-Basic DL projects

* Use **keras framework** later we can shift to tensorflow or pytorch
* Need to know how design custom neural network layers .

**Read all the research papers below from (https://arxiv.org/)**

* Resnet,densenet,Unet,inception -- read these papers completely
* Mask rcnn, Faster rcnn,SSD ,Yolo -- skimming is enough 

**Works:**
Take mnist dataset and build custom neural network models . Know where to use average pooling,
where to use max pooling and their purpose . Know about loss functions and activation function
change or tweek them and see .
achieve 99.4% accuracy in MNIST

### Step 3 - Multi class Classification

**Works:**

Multi class classification:

* Use pretrained models:
    - with cifar10,cifar100,mnist dataset - do classification with resnet and densenet 
* Without pretrained models train from scratch:
    - with cifar10,cifar100,mnist dataset - do classification with resnet and densenet 


### Step 4 - Multiclass Detection

**Works:**

Multiclass detection : (pretrained model)
* use yolo  and detect objects in a picture 
* use ssd and detect objects in a picture 
* use faster rcnn and detect objects in a picture 

Repeat above step for videos 


### Step 5 - Custom Multiclass Detection
(Most important in interviews) (post all your works in linkedin also after this step )

**Custom multi class detection : (do both in picture and video)**

* https://towardsdatascience.com/creating-your-own-object-detector-ad69dda69c85

### Step 6 - Multi class segmentation

Take mask rcnn and then train from scratch to implement in a video 

### Step 7 - Object Tracking

* Do Single class object tracking -   https://nanonets.com/blog/object-tracking-deepsort/

* Implement Single class object tracking  for single class multi instance tracking in video

* Read deep sort paper - https://lnkd.in/gx6DUvW

* Do Multi class object tracking - use deepsort and yolo



### Step 8 - Apply for interviews

Start exploring https://www.pyimagesearch.com/  --  if you hover over topics you can see many topics 
pick u r favorite and do projects .
You can do projects on OCR and GAN - I have not covered that area above .

**Have atleast 9 normal projects and 3 good projects that you have did on your own**

* Write 4 blogs about any 4 projects you have did above 
* Start applying for interview 
* Above things are enough for interview 
- The End

I studied Computer Vision from [The-School-of-AI-Bangalore](https://theschoolof.ai/) .Above are the
steps which i did that helped me to clear job interviews

**Next Update : I will update this repo with innovative projects**
